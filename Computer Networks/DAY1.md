   - Specifies details like voltage levels, data rates, and physical connectors.

### 3.1.2.3 TCP/IP Model: Layer-Wise Functioning

The TCP/IP model is a more practical, four-layer model widely used for internet communication:

- **Advantages**: Simple and easy to implement, cost-effective for small networks.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited scalability; performance degrades with more devices.
### 2. Star Topology
- **Description**: Each device is **connected to a central hub or switch**. All communication flows through this central point.
- **Advantages**: Centralized control, easy to add or remove devices, **fault isolation** (failure in one connection doesn't affect others).
- **Disadvantages**: Dependency on the central hub; if it fails, the entire network may be affected
### 3. Ring Topology
- **Description**: Devices are connected in a **closed loop**, with each device connected to exactly two others. Data circulates around the ring until it reaches the recipient.
- **Advantages**: Simple and easy to install, no central hub needed.
- **Disadvantages**: Failure of one device or connection can disrupt the entire network, scalability challenges.
### 4. Mesh Topology
- **Description**: **Every device is connected to every other device** in the network (full mesh) or only critical devices (partial mesh).
- **Advantages**: **High redundancy and fault tolerance**, no single point of failure.
- **Disadvantages**: Complex cabling and configuration, high cost and resource requirements.
### 5. Tree Topology
- **Description**: Combines star and bus topologies, arranging devices hierarchically with multiple levels connected through a central backbone.
- **Advantages**: Scalable, suitable for larger networks, easy to expand.
- **Disadvantages**: Dependency on the central backbone; its failure can affect connected networks.
### 6. Hybrid Topology
- **Description**: A **combination of two or more different topologies** (e.g., star-bus, star-ring).
- **Advantages**: Provides flexibility and customization to meet specific network requirements.
- **Disadvantages**: Complex to design and implement, requires careful planning.
### 7. Wireless Mesh Topology
- **Description**: Devices communicate wirelessly, forming a mesh network where each device can relay data for others, improving reliability and coverage.
- **Advantages**: Flexibility, easy to expand, resilient to node failures.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited by wireless range, potential for interference.

### 8. Point-to-Point Topology
- **Description**: A **direct connection between two devices**. Common in telecommunications and WANs.

- **Well-known Ports** (0 to 1023): Reserved for common services like HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
- **Registered Ports** (1024 to 49151): Registered for specific services by IANA upon request.
- **Dynamic/Private Ports** (49152 to 65535): Available for dynamic or private use, commonly used for temporary connections.

Ports are primarily used at the **transport layer** (Layer 4) of the OSI model for TCP and UDP communication. A **socket** is a combination of an IP address and a port number, representing the endpoint of a communication channel.
